description: Create a ViewModel following the MVI pattern for a GameStack screen. Use when asked to create a ViewModel, or as part of the new-feature skill.

## Construction
- Annotated with `@HiltViewModel`, constructor injected with the required UseCase(s) via `@Inject`.
- Defines three contracts — full rules in CLAUDE.md, Architecture →
  "MVI Contract conventions":
  - `UiState` — data class exposed as `StateFlow`, private `MutableStateFlow` backing it.
    Use a sealed class only when states are truly mutually exclusive, otherwise use data classes.
  - `UiEvent` — sealed class with all actions the UI can send.
  - `UiEffect` — sealed class for one-shot events, exposed via `Channel`/`receiveAsFlow()`.

  All three go in `feature/{name}/presentation/{ScreenName}Contract.kt`, not in
  the ViewModel file — see Location below.
- Single public entry point: `fun handleEvent(event: UiEvent)`, using a `when` to route to
  private handler functions.
- Use `.update { }` on the StateFlow to mutate state immutably.
- Use `UiText` (never raw strings) for any text exposed in UiState or UiEffect.

## Location
- ViewModel: `feature/{feature-name}/presentation/{ScreenName}ViewModel.kt`
- Contracts: `feature/{feature-name}/presentation/{ScreenName}Contract.kt`
  (all three in one file — the one-class-per-file exception in CLAUDE.md,
  Code Conventions → Tier 2)

## Naming convention
`{ScreenName}ViewModel`, `{ScreenName}UiState`, `{ScreenName}UiEvent`, `{ScreenName}UiEffect`
Example: `PopularGamesViewModel`, `PopularGamesUiState`, `PopularGamesUiEvent`, `PopularGamesUiEffect`

## Debounced input (search-style screens)
Never hand-roll this with a `Job` plus fields remembering which query was last
dispatched. `SearchViewModel` was written that way and produced four defects in
review, each one a disagreement between a remembered query and what was actually
on screen. Build it as a flow pipeline instead:

```kotlin
merge(typedQuery.map { it.trim() }.distinctUntilChanged().map { Request(it, isRefresh = false) },
      refreshRequests.map { Request(typedQuery.value.trim(), isRefresh = true) })
    .mapLatest { request ->
        delay(request.debounceMillis)   // 0 for a refresh or an emptied field
        if (request.query.isNotEmpty()) performSearch(request.query, request.isRefresh)
    }
    .launchIn(viewModelScope)
```

`distinctUntilChanged` after `trim` means a whitespace-only edit is not a new
query, so it neither restarts a search nor disturbs one in flight. `mapLatest`
cancels whatever the previous request was doing — waiting out its debounce, or
already awaiting a response. Let the empty query travel the pipeline; reaching
`mapLatest` is what cancels work for text the user just deleted.

**Put the wait inside `mapLatest`, never in a `debounce()` operator upstream of
it.** With the operator, a new keystroke is held for its own timeout *before*
`mapLatest` ever sees it, so the previous request keeps running and its response
can still land — painting settled results, or flashing the error card, for the
whole debounce window after the query changed. That is the same user-visible
failure CLAUDE.md's `runCatching` rule exists to prevent, arriving by a different
route. It was caught in review; the pipeline reads almost identically either way,
which is exactly why it is worth stating.

Set `isLoading` optimistically in the event handler, so the skeleton appears
during the debounce rather than after it, and clear `errorMessage` there too —
only when the effective query actually changed, so a whitespace edit disturbs
nothing.

## Quality criteria
- No business logic — the ViewModel only orchestrates UseCase calls and maps results to UiState.
- Every UiEvent has a corresponding handler.
- Every error path from a UseCase updates UiState and/or triggers a UiEffect.
- After creating the ViewModel, invoke the `write-tests` skill to generate its corresponding unit tests.
